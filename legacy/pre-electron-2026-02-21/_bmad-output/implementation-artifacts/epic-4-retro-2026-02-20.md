# Epic 4 Retrospective - Design Screen UI Alignment

Status: done

## Epic Summary

- Epic: 4
- Stories: 4 total / 4 done
- Focus: dashboard + modal UI alignment against design screen references

## What Went Well

1. Story scope was clear and incremental (dashboard -> student modal -> lesson modal -> extra entry file).
2. UI alignment work reused existing structure, minimizing behavior regressions in app logic.
3. `public/dashboard.html` was introduced and kept aligned with the same visual updates.
4. After follow-up reliability work, E2E remained stable with full pass.

## What Did Not Go Well

1. Design-alignment stories completed, but some implementation artifact depth was lighter than later workflows.
2. Duplicated entry HTML (`index` and `dashboard`) increases sync overhead for future UI changes.

## Key Lessons Learned

1. For UI-heavy epics, keeping story granularity by surface area improved delivery control.
2. Duplicated static entry points should be treated as paired changes in every UI PR/task.
3. Design alignment should include explicit selector/automation sanity checks to reduce later test churn.

## Action Items

- [ ] Add a lightweight UI parity checklist for `public/index.html` and `public/dashboard.html`.
  - Owner: Dev
  - Type: Quality guard
- [ ] Add one smoke E2E assertion specifically validating `/dashboard.html` rendering path.
  - Owner: QA/Dev
  - Type: Test coverage
- [ ] Keep epic-level wrap-up artifacts mandatory for future UI epics.
  - Owner: Scrum Master
  - Type: Process consistency

## Next Epic Readiness

- No `Epic 5` planning artifact is present in `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts`.
- Existing epics (1-4) are complete, and current state is ready for next planning intake.
