# Epic 3 Retrospective - Stabilization and Test Reliability

Status: done

## Epic Summary

- Epic: 3
- Stories: 3 total / 3 done
- Focus: lesson edit/delete reliability, E2E stabilization, modal title selector alignment

## What Went Well

1. Failure reproduction was immediate and deterministic (`#lessonTitle` hidden input targeting issue).
2. Fix was minimal and aligned with spec intent (optional but visible/editable title field).
3. Regression verification was clear: full Playwright suite moved from 8/10 to 10/10 pass.
4. `public/index.html` and `public/dashboard.html` were kept in sync for modal behavior consistency.

## What Did Not Go Well

1. Initialization already identified a known selector mismatch, but it remained open into active implementation.
2. Story-level artifact coverage for Epic 3 was lighter than Epic 4, making traceability weaker.

## Key Lessons Learned

1. UI tests that target IDs must verify visibility/editability assumptions, not only selector existence.
2. When duplicate entry HTML files exist, mirrored UI changes should be updated in the same change set.
3. Reliability stories should include artifact updates (status/report) as part of definition of done.

## Action Items

- [ ] Add a short pre-check in E2E authoring: "targeted fields must be visible and editable."
  - Owner: Dev
  - Type: Process quality
- [ ] Add a lightweight test-data hygiene task for local DB growth control.
  - Owner: Dev
  - Type: Test reliability
- [ ] Keep a per-story implementation artifact for future stabilization stories.
  - Owner: Scrum Master
  - Type: Traceability

## Next Epic Readiness

- No Epic 5 planning artifact detected in `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts`.
- Current codebase is stable for new planning or ad-hoc story intake.
